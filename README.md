Some Important and Commonly used keywords 
<h1>**HARDWARE TERMS**</h1>
<body>
Hardware is the term referring to all the physical parts in a computer system. It includes the monitor, the keyboard, the mouse, the main case which stores the RAM, CPU and the motherboard.

<h3><b>1.Motherboard</h3><br>
The motherboard (sometimes called the mainboard or logic board) is the main circuit board in a computer or device. All internal components connect to the motherboard in some fashion including the RAM, hard drive(s), power supply, USB ports, etc.
The motherboard is generally housed within a casing providing access ports for supported external devices like the keyboard, mouse and monitor.

<h3><b>2.CPU</h3>  <br>
CPU means ‘Central Processing Unit’. This is the place of computer data handling. Moreover, it does all the data manipulation, calculations and formatting data for output. 

<h3><b>3.GPUs (Graphic Processing Unit)</b></h3><br>
A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit initially designed for digital image processing and to accelerate computer graphics, being present either as a discrete video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.

<h3><b>4.APUs (Accelerated Processing Units)</b></h3><br>
An accelerated processing unit (APU) is a microprocessor that combines the central processing unit (CPU) with the graphics processing unit (GPU) on a single computer chip.

<h3><b>5.DPUs (Data Processing Units)</h3><br>
A data processing unit (DPU) is a programmable computer processor that tightly integrates a general-purpose CPU with network interface hardware.Sometimes they are called "IPUs" (for "infrastructure processing unit") or "SmartNICs".

<h3><b>6.RAM</h3> <br>
Specifically, RAM stands for “Random Access Memory” or “Ready Access Memory”. It is a temporary notepad where your computer sends information to disk, or to the storage place of instructions from other input devices. The term “random access” indicates that memory locations in RAM are accessible in any order unlike sequential access of a data cassette tape.

<h3><b>7.FPGAs (Field Programming Gate Arrays)</b></h3><br>
A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a type of configurable integrated circuit that can be repeatedly programmed after manufacturing. FPGAs are a subset of logic devices referred to as programmable logic devices (PLDs). They consist of an array of programmable logic blocks with a connecting grid, that can be configured "in the field" to interconnect with other logic blocks to perform various digital functions

<h3><b>8.NPUs (Nerual Processing Units) or AI accelerators</h3>
An AI accelerator, deep learning processor or neural processing unit (NPU) is a class of specialized hardware accelerator[1] or computer system designed to accelerate artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, including artificial neural networks and computer vision. Typical applications include algorithms for robotics, Internet of Things, and other data-intensive or sensor-driven tasks.
  
<h3><b>9.CISCS (Computer Instruction Set Commands)</h3><br>
A complex instruction set computer (CISC) is a computer architecture in which single instructions can execute several low-level operations or are capable of multi-step operations.

<h3><b>10.RISCs (Reduced Instruction Set Commands)</h3><br>
In electronics and computer science, a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) is a computer architecture designed to simplify the individual instructions given to the computer to accomplish tasks. Compared to the instructions given to a complex instruction set computer (CISC), a RISC computer might require more instructions (more code) in order to accomplish a task because the individual instructions are written in simpler code.

<h3><b>11.RISC-V</h3>  <br>
As a RISC architecture, the RISC-V ISA is a load–store architecture. Notable features of the RISC-V ISA include: instruction bit field locations chosen to simplify the use of multiplexers in a CPU,

<h3><b>12.SOC (System on a chip)</h3><br>
A system on a chip or system-on-chip is an integrated circuit that integrates most or all components of a computer or other electronic system. These components almost always include on-chip central processing unit (CPU), memory interfaces, input/output devices and interfaces, and secondary storage interfaces, often alongside other components such as radio modems and a graphics processing unit (GPU) – all on a single substrate or microchip.

<h3><b>13.CXL (Compute Express Link)</h3><br>
Compute Express Link (CXL) is an open standard interconnect for high-speed, high capacity central processing unit (CPU)-to-device and CPU-to-memory connections, designed for high performance data center computers.

<h3><b>14.Processor Registers</h3><br>
A processor register is a quickly accessible location available to a computer's processor.[1] Registers usually consist of a small amount of fast storage, although some registers have specific hardware functions, and may be read-only or write-only.

<h1>**SOFTWARE**</h1> <br>

Software consists of computer programs that instruct the execution of a computer.

<h3><b>1.OS (Operating Syatem)</b></h3><br>
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. 

<h3><b>2.BIOS</b></h3><br>
In computing, BIOS (Basic Input/Output System, also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS, BIOS ROM or PC BIOS) is firmware used to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs and to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup).

<h3><b>3.Virtual Machine</b></h3><br>
Virtual machines (VMs) allow a business to run an operating system that behaves like a completely separate computer in an app window on a desktop. VMs may be deployed to accommodate different levels of processing power needs, to run software

<h3><b>4.Kernel</b></h3><br>
The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system. The kernel is also responsible for preventing and mitigating conflicts between different processes.

<h3><b>7.Firmware</b></h3><br>
In computing, firmware is software that provides low-level control of computing device hardware. For a relatively simple device, firmware may perform all control, monitoring and data manipulation functionality.
