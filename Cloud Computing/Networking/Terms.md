# Comprehensive Computer Networking Terms

This document provides an overview of essential computer networking terms with explanations.

---

## 1. **Network Topology**
The arrangement of different elements (links, nodes, etc.) in a network. Common types include:
- **Bus Topology**
- **Star Topology**
- **Mesh Topology**
- **Ring Topology**
- **Hybrid Topology**

---

## 2. **IP Address**
A unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network:
- **IPv4**: 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334)

---

## 3. **MAC Address**
A unique identifier for network interfaces used in local network communication.

---

## 4. **Subnetting**
Dividing a network into smaller subnetworks for improved performance and management.

---

## 5. **Router**
A device that routes data between different networks.

---

## 6. **Switch**
Connects multiple devices in a network and forwards data based on MAC addresses.

---

## 7. **DNS (Domain Name System)**
Translates domain names to IP addresses.

---

## 8. **Firewall**
A security system that monitors and controls network traffic.

---

## 9. **LAN (Local Area Network)**
A network covering a small geographic area.

---

## 10. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**
A network that spans a large geographic area.

---

## 11. **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**
Creates a secure and encrypted connection over a public network.

---

## 12. **Bandwidth**
The maximum rate of data transfer in a network, measured in bps.

---

## 13. **Latency**
The time delay in data transmission, measured in milliseconds.

---

## 14. **Ping**
A tool for testing network connectivity and measuring round-trip time.

---

## 15. **Proxy Server**
Acts as an intermediary between a client and a server for requests and responses.

---

## 16. **Gateway**
A node that serves as an access point between two different networks.

---

## 17. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices in a network.

---

## 18. **NAT (Network Address Translation)**
Translates private IP addresses to a public IP address and vice versa for internet access.

---

## 19. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
A connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transfer.

---

## 20. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
A connectionless protocol providing faster, less reliable data transfer.

---

## 21. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**
Used to transfer files between a client and a server.

---

## 22. **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**
An encrypted version of HTTP for secure communication over the internet.

---

## 23. **OSI Model**
A conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven layers:
1. **Physical**
2. **Data Link**
3. **Network**
4. **Transport**
5. **Session**
6. **Presentation**
7. **Application**

---

## 24. **Port**
A communication endpoint for sending and receiving data packets (e.g., Port 80 for HTTP, Port 443 for HTTPS).

---

## 25. **Load Balancer**
Distributes network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed.
